## Tuples
- They are ordered, imutable(cannot be changed, add, replace or remove) collection of items.
- They are defined by enclossing elements in parenthesis/ small brackets()

## Sets
- They are unordered collection of unique elements (Cannot have identical elements).
- They are useful for membership testing, removing duplicates from a sequence and mathmatical operations like union, intersections and difference.
- Cannot access elements using index operator []. Need to check if the elements exist in the set. 
- Defined by enclosing elements in curly brackets {}.
